   <UL><LI><p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO FOOD WASTAGE</strong></p></LI> </UL>
    
    <p> Food wastage by commercial organizations means the amount of food that is lost or thrown away by businesses such as restaurants, grocery stores, and institutional food services. This can have negative impacts on the environment, economy, and food security. According to the FDA, over 63 million tons of food waste were generated in the commercial sector in 2018 in the USÂ². Some possible solutions to reduce food wastage by commercial organizations include selling or donating unsold or nearly expired food, offering discounts or promotions, and composting or recycling food waste.Food wastage by commercial organizations takes place across the supply chain, including during transit, storage, and marketing.One of the significant reasons for food wastage is the rejection of food when it arrives at the buyer. The sector could use technology and data transparency to stop food from being rejected and divert it for use elsewhere .

        Reducing food waste is crucial for improving social, economic, and environmental outcomes. The significance of reducing food loss and waste for improving social, economic, and environment outcomes is also recognized in Target 12.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which calls for reducing food loss and halving food waste by 2030.

                <h4>1. Generation of food wastage by commercial Organisations</h4>
                <p>Food waste is a significant concern globally, with commercial establishments playing a substantial role in its generation. From restaurants and hotels to supermarkets and catering services, these organizations contribute to the wastage of large quantities of food each year. This not only has economic implications for the businesses but also has profound environmental and social consequences.

                Environmental Impact:
                Commercial food waste contributes to environmental degradation in multiple ways. Decomposing food in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas that significantly contributes to climate change. Additionally, the resources used in the production, transportation, and disposal of food are wasted when it ends up in landfills. By addressing food waste, businesses can make a positive impact on the environment.
                
                Social Responsibility:
                As pillars of their communities, commercial organizations have a responsibility to act in the best interests of society. Addressing food waste aligns with corporate social responsibility by helping to alleviate hunger and reduce the strain on resources. Donating surplus food to local charities and food banks is one effective way for businesses to give back to the community.
                
                Economic Considerations:
                Food waste represents a financial loss for commercial establishments. Implementing measures to reduce waste can lead to significant cost savings. Improved inventory management, portion control, and creative menu planning are just a few examples of strategies that can help businesses minimize their economic losses associated with food waste.
                
                Regulatory Compliance:
                Many regions are increasingly implementing regulations to address food waste. Being proactive in waste reduction not only aligns with ethical practices but also helps businesses comply with existing and future legislation. This can protect commercial organizations from potential legal and reputational risks.

<h5>2. Impact of food wastage on natural resources</h5>
<p>Food wastage has significant implications for natural resources, contributing to environmental degradation and resource depletion in several ways. Here are some of the key effects of food wastage on natural resources:
<ul>
   <li>Land Use:
    The production of food requires vast amounts of land for farming. When food is wasted, it essentially means that the resources used to cultivate and harvest that food, including land, have been utilized without yielding their full benefit. This inefficient use of land contributes to deforestation and habitat loss, as more land is cleared for agricultural purposes.
    </li>
   <li> Water Consumption:
    Agriculture is a water-intensive activity, and the cultivation of crops requires substantial water resources. When food is wasted, the water used in the production process is essentially squandered. This contributes to water scarcity issues, particularly in regions where water resources are already under stress.
    </li>
   <li> Energy Consumption:
    The production, transportation, and processing of food involve significant energy inputs. When food is wasted, all the energy invested in bringing that food to the table is wasted as well. This includes the energy used in planting, harvesting, processing, packaging, and transportation. Reducing food wastage can contribute to overall energy conservation.
    </li>
   <li> Biodiversity Impact:
    The expansion of agricultural activities to meet the demand for food often leads to habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity. When food is wasted, it intensifies the pressure to cultivate more land, exacerbating the negative impact on ecosystems and contributing to the decline of biodiversity.
    </li>
   <li>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:
    Food waste in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas that significantly contributes to climate change. The decomposition of organic matter in landfills, including wasted food, releases methane into the atmosphere. By reducing food wastage, we can help mitigate the impact of these emissions on climate change.
    </li>
   <li> Fertilizer and Pesticide Use:
    The production of food often involves the use of fertilizers and pesticides. When food is wasted, the resources expended in applying these inputs go to waste as well. Excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and harm to ecosystems.
    </li>
   <li>Soil Erosion:
    Agricultural practices, especially those associated with large-scale farming, can contribute to soil erosion. When food is wasted, the land that was used for cultivation may be left exposed, increasing the risk of soil erosion and further depleting valuable topsoil.
    </li>
  <li>  Resource Depletion:
    Food wastage represents a squandering of various resources, including soil nutrients, minerals, and other inputs required for agricultural production. As these resources are depleted without yielding their full benefit, it puts additional pressure on ecosystems and contributes to overall resource depletion.</p>

<h6>3. Waste Food Management</h6>
<p>Food waste management refers to the systematic approach and the strategies implemented to handle and redirect food and agricultural products for better purposes such as human consumption, animal feed, industrial application, and other environmental benefits . In the food industry, food waste is generated in different stages including the primary production, distribution, and sale of food products, and the preparation and serving of food in commercial and domestic environments .

    <br>IFSA specializes in food waste management and disposal.The whole process of food waste management should be done by keeping the natural resources safe and conserved .</p>

    <p>::The following are some of the processes involved in food waste management:</p>
    <ul><li>Source Reduction: This involves reducing the amount of food waste generated at the source. This can be achieved by reducing the amount of food purchased, improving inventory management, and reducing portion sizes.</li>
    <li>Composting: This is the process of breaking down organic waste into a nutrient-rich soil amendment. Composting can be done on-site or off-site, and the resulting compost can be used for landscaping, gardening, and agriculture.</li>
    <li>Anaerobic Digestion: This is the process of breaking down organic waste in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas and digestate. Biogas can be used as a fuel for heating or electricity generation, while digestate can be used as a fertilizer.</li>
    <li>Animal Feed: Food waste can be used as animal feed, which can help reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill.</li>
    <li>Landfill: This is the least favored disposal option for waste generated in food and beverage producers worldwide. However, it is still a common method of waste disposal.</li>

<h8>Food wastage in india</h8>
<p>
    <br><br>
    Here's a data of food wastage in india: <br> <br>
    Around 17% of food produced worldwide in retail, food servicing and by households â amounting to nearly a billion tonnes â is wasted every year. Nearly 14% of the total food produced globally is lost between the harvest and retail stages.

    India's contribution to wasted food, at 68.8 million tonnes annually, is 7% of the global total, per the United Nations Environment Programme's Food Waste Index Report 2021. An Indian household, on average, wastes 50 kg of food every year, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution told the Parliament in March 2022. This was much less than most developed countries, the ministry had said. However, every fourth hungry person worldwide, is an Indian.
